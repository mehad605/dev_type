# Typing Behavior Fixes - Complete ✅

## Overview
Fixed three critical issues with typing behavior and added a new important feature for better user experience.

## Implementation Date
Completed: October 13, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Show Typed Character Setting** - FIXED

**Problem:** The "Show typed character" setting was not working correctly. The logic was inverted.

**Expected Behavior:**
- **When ENABLED**: Show what the user actually typed (e.g., 'x' in red instead of 'c')
- **When DISABLED**: Show what was expected (e.g., 'c' in red even though user typed 'x')

**Fixed Implementation:**
```python
if is_correct:
    display_char = char  # Always show correct character
else:
    display_char = char if show_typed else expected
```

### 2. ✅ **Cursor Type and Style** - FIXED

**Problem:** Cursor settings only partially implemented.

**Fixed:**
- **Block cursor**: Now covers full character width using font metrics
- **Underscore cursor**: Thin 2px line
- **I-beam cursor**: Standard 1px vertical line

---

### 3. ✅ **Allow Continue on Error** - NEW FEATURE

**Default:** ✅ Enabled

**When ENABLED (Default):**
- User types wrong character → Character shown in red
- Cursor advances to next position
- User can continue typing
- Natural typing flow

**When DISABLED:**
- User types wrong character → Character shown in red
- Cursor STAYS at that position
- User MUST type correct character to advance
- Forces immediate correction

**Example:**
```
Expected: "here is johnny"
User types: "herr is johnny"  (wrong 'r' instead of 'e')

ENABLED:  "herr is johnny" ← Can continue typing
DISABLED: "herr..."        ← Stuck until 'e' is typed correctly
```

## Testing

- ✅ **64 tests passing** (added 2 new tests)
- ✅ `test_continue_on_error_enabled` - Verifies advance on error
- ✅ `test_continue_on_error_disabled` - Verifies stay on error
- ✅ All existing tests updated and passing

---

## Files Modified

1. **`app/typing_engine.py`** - Added `advance_on_error` parameter
2. **`app/typing_area.py`** - Fixed show_typed logic, improved cursor, added continue logic
3. **`app/ui_main.py`** - Added new checkbox for allow_continue_on_error
4. **`tests/test_typing_engine.py`** - Updated and added new tests

**Total**: ~80 lines changed
