# Settings Fixes - Complete ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Show Typed Character - Label Fixed**

**Before:**
```
☐ Show typed character (not expected)
```
- Confusing label
- Users didn't understand what it does

**After:**
```
☐ Show what you typed (when wrong, show 'x' instead of 'c')
```
- Clear, descriptive label
- Explains exactly what happens

### 2. ✅ **Show Typed Character - Functionality Fixed**

**Problem:**
- Setting wasn't actually being used during typing
- Was reading from database on each keystroke instead of using stored value
- Dynamic updates weren't working

**Solution:**
- Store `show_typed_char` as instance variable in TypingAreaWidget
- Load from settings on initialization
- Use stored value during keystroke processing
- Update stored value when setting changes

**Implementation:**
```python
class TypingAreaWidget(QTextEdit):
    def __init__(self):
        # Load and store setting
        self.show_typed_char = settings.get_setting("show_typed_char", "1") == "1"
    
    def keyPressEvent(self, event):
        # Use stored value, not database read
        if is_correct:
            display_char = char
        else:
            display_char = char if self.show_typed_char else expected
    
    def update_show_typed(self, show_typed: bool):
        # Update stored value for immediate effect
        self.show_typed_char = show_typed
```

### 3. ✅ **Settings Persistence - Verified Working**

**Verification:**
- ✅ Settings are saved to SQLite database with `commit()`
- ✅ `set_setting()` uses `INSERT OR REPLACE` for reliability
- ✅ Settings load correctly on app restart
- ✅ All settings persist across sessions

**Test Results:**
```
✅ show_typed_char setting persists correctly
✅ TypingAreaWidget loads show_typed_char correctly
✅ test_settings_db_roundtrip PASSED
```

## Behavior Verification

### Test Case 1: Show Typed = ENABLED (Default)
```
Expected: "hello"
User types: "xello"

Result: Display "xello" with 'x' in red
✅ Shows what user actually typed
```

### Test Case 2: Show Typed = DISABLED
```
Expected: "hello"
User types: "xello"

Result: Display "hello" with 'h' in red
✅ Shows what was expected
```

### Test Case 3: Settings Persistence
```
1. Enable show_typed ✓
2. Close app
3. Reopen app
4. Setting still enabled ✓

1. Disable show_typed ✓
2. Close app
3. Reopen app
4. Setting still disabled ✓
```
