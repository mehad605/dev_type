You should first always make a todo list and show me then one at a time implement things.

You should make sure no one file does too much thing. Everything should do small task it should be modular. So that it is easy to understand and contribute to.

When you implement any feature make sure to write test for it too that when future features are implemented tests can be run to make sure that previuos features are not broken.

Before you implement any new feature always run test first then after implementing run tests again.

Use uv for everything like uv init uv add uv run etc.
